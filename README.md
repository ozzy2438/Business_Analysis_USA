# Business Readiness USA ‚Äî County Expansion Analytics

**A practical, end‚Äëto‚Äëend framework to identify the best US counties for business expansion.**  
Data modeled in **SQL**, engineered & validated with **Python**, and delivered as an interactive **Power BI** dashboard.

## Project Overview
**Business Readiness USA** evaluates and ranks every US county using growth, diversity, and specialization signals to answer three questions:
1) *Where should we expand next?*  
2) *Which places are stable vs. high‚Äërisk?*  
3) *Which industry mixes correlate with durable establishment & employment growth?*

Deliverables:
- Clean, analysis‚Äëready SQL tables (single source of truth)
- Reproducible Python notebook for feature engineering & validation
- A Power BI report for exploration, ranking, and storytelling

---

## Problem & Objectives
**Problem.** Expansion teams need a defensible way to compare counties across the US using consistent metrics‚Äînot anecdotes.

**Objectives.**
- Build a transparent, repeatable pipeline from raw CBP to an **Opportunity Score** and **Tiering (A‚ÄìE)**.
- Detect **high‚Äërisk** counties and **multi‚Äëspecialized** economies (‚â•3 specializations).
- Publish an interactive dashboard with executive KPIs, a national map, rankings, and drivers.

## Data Pipeline (SQL ‚Üí Python ‚Üí Power BI)

**SQL (modeling & QA)**
- Normalize CBP 2020‚Äì2023, enforce **zero‚Äëpadded FIPS** keys.
- Compute establishment & employment growth, per‚Äëcapita density, and specialization features.
- Materialize clean fact tables: e.g., `county_business_readiness_2023`, `county_industry_mix_2023`, `county_opportunity_drivers`, `county_rankings_topline`.

**Python (feature engineering & validation)**
- Standardize inputs, mitigate outliers, and assemble the **Opportunity Score**.
- Validate correlations and stability across years; export `*.parquet` for BI.
- (Optional) Build a choropleth with county **GeoJSON** for QA.

**Power BI (delivery)**
- KPI cards + national map + rankings + drivers.
- Slicers for **STNAME**, **opportunity_tier**, **risk_category**, **total_specializations**.

---

## Key Metrics & Business Logic
- **Opportunity Score** ‚Äî composite index of growth & structure signals.
- **Opportunity Percentile / Tier (A‚ÄìE)** ‚Äî rank & banding for prioritization.
- **High‚ÄëRisk** ‚Äî rule/score‚Äëbased flag combining weak growth + low diversity.
- **Multi‚ÄëSpecialized (‚â•3)** ‚Äî counties with broader competitive strengths.
- **Market Potential** ‚Äî index capturing size/structure pull for expansion.
- **Expansion Ready** ‚Äî top decile (P90+) on readiness composite.

> Map note: Use **FIPS** as 5‚Äëcharacter *Text* (`FORMAT([FIPS], "00000")`) or join to GeoJSON on `GEOID`.

---

## Results at a Glance
Snapshot from the latest run (may vary with refresh):
- **Total counties:** **3,181**
- **Top opportunity score:** **1,214**
- **Average establishment growth:** **4.87%**
- **High‚Äërisk counties:** **264**
- **Tier‚ÄëA counties:** **779**
- **Multi‚Äëspecialized (‚â•3):** **1,494**
- **Market potential leader (index):** **33,374**
- **Expansion‚Äëready (P90+):** **312**

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. (Optional) Build features with the notebook in `/notebooks` and export to `parquet/csv`.
3. Load the processed data to your SQL warehouse **or** import directly into Power BI.
4. In Power BI, ensure **FIPS is Text** (5 chars). If needed:  
   `FIPS_str = FORMAT('county_business_readiness_2023'[FIPS], "00000")`
5. Use `FIPS_str` for map Location; color by `opportunity_score`; add slicers for `STNAME`, `opportunity_tier`, `risk_category`, `total_specializations`.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Geography keys matter.** Mapping issues (‚Äúundefined‚Äù) disappear when FIPS is padded to 5‚Äëchar **Text** and joined consistently to GeoJSON `GEOID`.
- **Scale vs. limits.** SQL Server parameter limits were avoided by writing in **small chunks** from Python during bulk operations.
- **Explainable scoring.** Keeping intermediate drivers (growth %, per‚Äë1k, diversity, LQ caps) makes the score auditable and easy to defend.
- **Design for decisions.** KPI cards + tiering + slicers let stakeholders jump from national to county‚Äëlevel actions in seconds.

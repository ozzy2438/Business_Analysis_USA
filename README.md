## Background & Overview

This project evaluates and ranks all US counties using growth, structure, and specialization signals to support expansion planning. The goal is to transform raw County Business Patterns (CBP) and Census population data into a transparent "Opportunity Score" and tiering system that helps business and strategy teams answer:

- Where should we expand next?
- Which places are resilient vs. highâ€‘risk?
- Which industry mixes underpin durable establishment and employment growth?

The output includes ranked county tables, specialization profiles, and geoâ€‘ready layers suitable for BI dashboards.

---

## Data Structure Overview

- Sources
  - CBP county files (2020â€“2023): establishments and employment by NAICS.
  - Census county population (2024 release): total population by county; 2022 used for perâ€‘capita normalization.

- Core outputs (CSV/GeoJSON/Parquet where relevant)
  - `county_business_readiness_2023.csv`: master table with Opportunity Score, tier, growth, perâ€‘capita density, diversity, specialization summary, top industry LQ.
  - `county_industry_mix_2023.csv`: county Ã— NAICSâ€‘2 establishments, shares, and LQ.
  - `county_industry_clusters_2023.csv`: kâ€‘means cluster (k=5), specialization flags, mean shares by strategy bucket.
  - `county_opportunity_drivers.csv`: zâ€‘scored inputs used in scoring (clipped Â±3) for auditability.
  - `county_growth_2020_2023_with_industry.csv`: growth panel and topâ€‘5 NAICS LQs per county.

- Key columns (selected)
  - `FIPS` (text 5): primary key across all outputs; zeroâ€‘padded.
  - `estab_growth_pct`, `empl_growth_pct`: 2020â†’2023 percentage change (county totals).
  - `estab_per_1k`, `empl_per_1k`: 2023 perâ€‘capita density using 2022 population.
  - `diversity`: 1 âˆ’ HHI over NAICSâ€‘2 shares (higher = more diverse).
  - `top1_naics`, `top1_LQ_capped`: dominant NAICSâ€‘2 and capped LQ (â‰¤10).
  - `opportunity_score`, `opportunity_tier`: composite score and A/B/C/D banding.

- Methods (Python highlights)
  - Typeâ€‘safe ingestion, FIPS normalization, robust NAICS filtering.
  - Location Quotients (county share / US share) with outlier capping at 10.
  - Diversity (HHI) computed on NAICSâ€‘2 shares; rowâ€‘normalized matrices.
  - Kâ€‘means clustering (k=5) on share vectors to profile economic types.
  - Scoring via weighted zâ€‘scores (clipped Â±3):
    - Weights: establishments growth 0.35, employment growth 0.20, establishments perâ€‘1k 0.20, diversity 0.15, multiâ€‘specialization (â‰¥2) 0.10.
    - If industry features are missing, diversity and multiâ€‘specialization contributions are set to 0.

- Key terms & abbreviations
  - FIPS: Federal Information Processing Series county code (5â€‘char text).
  - NAICSâ€‘2: 2â€‘digit industry code.
  - LQ: Location Quotient (county share Ã· US share), capped at 10 for reporting.
  - HHI: Herfindahlâ€“Hirschman Index; diversity = 1 âˆ’ HHI.
  - perâ€‘1k: per 1,000 residents (population = 2022).

## Executive Summary

**Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]**

*Example format:*
- **X**: Improved customer retention by 15%
- **Y**: using an Excel KPI dashboard
- **Z**: By data-driven email marketing campaigns

This pipeline ranks 3,181 US counties and produces geoâ€‘ready outputs for BI. Tiering concentrates attention: 314 Tierâ€‘A and 626 Tierâ€‘B counties (50 with incomplete industry features flagged). Average 2020â†’2023 establishment growth is ~4.9% and employment growth ~6.0%. Results are auditâ€‘ready (zâ€‘scored inputs, LQ caps) and mapped for 3,131 counties.

---

## Insights Deep Dive

- **Growth dynamics**: Mean establishment growth 4.9% (median 3.7%); mean employment growth 6.0% (median 3.0%).
- **Perâ€‘capita density**: Establishments perâ€‘1k mean 118.6 (range ~9.1 to ~1085.1); employment perâ€‘1k mean 1,372.4 (range ~51.9 to ~23,361.7). Smallâ€‘population counties can exhibit extreme perâ€‘capita and LQ values.
- **Diversity (structure)**: HHI mean 0.120 (diversity mean 0.880; median 0.899). Lower HHI is associated with more balanced industry mixes.
- **Specialization coverage (LQ â‰¥ 1.25)**: Retail/Services 83.1%, Logistics/Trade 55.7%, Manufacturing 42.3%, Pro/Tech 41.3%, Health/Edu 15.0%. 2,540 counties show multiâ€‘specialization (â‰¥2 buckets).
- **LQ outliers**: 824 counties hit the LQ cap of 10 for their top industry; capping is applied to stabilize comparisons and visuals.
- **Geo join coverage**: 3,131 of 3,235 county polygons matched; 50 are listed in `exports/missing_geometry_counties.csv` for followâ€‘up.

---

## Recommendations

- **Prioritize Tierâ€‘A markets** for immediate expansion; shortâ€‘list Tierâ€‘B counties with multiâ€‘specialization and strong perâ€‘capita density.
- **Target segments by specialization** (e.g., Logistics/Trade and Retail/Services) with tailored outreach and partner development.
- **Balance specialization with diversity**: favor counties with strong LQs but moderate HHI (higher diversity) to mitigate sector risk.
- **Monitor lowâ€‘growth counties** with high specialization for signs of structural change; consider staged entry or partnerships.
- **Operationalize**: load the master table into your data warehouse and plug into BI for ongoing refresh (retain LQ caps and zâ€‘score clipping for stability).

---

## Caveats & Assumptions

- CBP suppressions (`N`) are treated as missing; totals exclude NAICS "allâ€‘sector" rollâ€‘ups.
- Population uses Census 2022 (AGEGRP=0) for perâ€‘capita normalization.
- LQs are capped at 10 to reduce dominance of smallâ€‘base counties; counts of capped observations are disclosed.
- 50 counties did not join to geometry in the 2022 county shapefile; see `exports/missing_geometry_counties.csv`.
- Some micro counties exhibit extreme perâ€‘capita/LQ metrics due to very small populations; interpret paired with diversity and growth.
- Scoring inputs are zâ€‘scored with clipping (Â±3); counties lacking industry features have diversity/multiâ€‘specialization contributions set to 0.
